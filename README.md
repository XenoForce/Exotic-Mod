# Exotic Mod - Clone

This is a clone of the original Exotic Mod, with most of the chaos and silliness still intact. (I may try to fix some of it later.)

This is also a port of the original Exotic Mod to Mindustry v7. (I suspect the original content creator may never actually port this particular version of Exotic Mod to Mindustry v7, and therefore I decided to give it a try, as a learning exercise.)

At the time when this clone was made, Exotic Mod was released under the GPLv3.

This cloning effort is also released under the GPLv3.

Those who want to, are encouraged to copy this mod and modify it, to suit their particular needs.

Just for completeness, here is a link to the original Exotic Mod source code repository: https://github.com/BlueWolf3682/Exotic-Mod
