# Exotic Mod - Clone

This is a working and playable clone of the original Exotic Mod.

This mod runs under Mindustry v7.

In order to make this mod run under Mindustry v7, numerous changes were made to the original source code.

(It is believed that the original content creator may never actually port this particular version of Exotic Mod to Mindustry v7, because he/she is already working on a completely new version of Exotic Mod, which is basically a complete re-write of everything.)

In order to make this mod work smoothly, and have a logical gameplay progression through the components of this mod, numerous changes were made to the original source code.

In most cases, the research cost of individual, unlockable components on the Tech Tree, was reduced to more reasonable values, in an effort to reduce the grinding burdon put on the player.

In some places where the code was obviously still incomplete, the missing parts were filled in.

**Disclaimer:**

At the time when this clone was made, Exotic Mod was released under the GPLv3.

This cloning effort is also released under the GPLv3.

Those who want to, are encouraged to copy and/or fork this mod and modify it, to suit their particular needs.
